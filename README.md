Two segment hopping model actuated by a hill type muscle in between them

This is the replication of the paper titled "Positive force feedback in bouncing gaits?" written by Hartmut Geyer, Andre Seyfarth and Reinhard Blickhan which shows convincing evidence that reflex generated muscle commands may be responsible for periodic hopping, instead of commands from the brain.

Abstract: During bouncing gaits (running, hopping, trotting), passive compliant structures (e.g. tendons, ligaments)
 store and release part of the stride energy. Here, active muscles must provide the required force to with
stand the developing tendon strain and to compensate for the inevitable energy losses. This requires an
 appropriate control of muscle activation. In this study, for hopping, the potential involvement of afferent
 information from muscle receptors (muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs) is investigated using a two
segment leg model with one extensor muscle. It is found that: (i) positive feedbacks of muscle-fibre length
 and muscle force can result in periodic bouncing; (ii) positive force feedback (F ) stabilizes bouncing
 patterns within a large range of stride energies (maximum hopping height of 16.3 cm, almost twofold
 higher than the length feedback); and (iii) when employing this reflex scheme, for moderate hopping
 heights (up to 8.8 cm), an overall elastic leg behaviour is predicted (hopping frequency of 1.4–3 Hz, leg
 stiffness of 9–27 kN m1). Furthermore, F could stabilize running. It is suggested that, during the stance
 phase of bouncing tasks, the reflex-generated motor control based on feedbacks might be an efficient and
 reliable alternative to central motor commands.
